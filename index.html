            <td>1</td>
            <td>Continuous Integration (CI)</td>
            <td>Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. Each integration is automatically verified by running automated tests, ensuring that the codebase is always in a working state. CI reduces integration problems and helps teams deliver code faster and with higher quality.</td>
            <td>Martin Fowler - "Continuous Integration" (https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Continuous Delivery (CD)</td>
            <td>Continuous Delivery extends CI by automatically deploying code changes to production or staging environments after successful testing. It ensures that code is always in a releasable state, allowing teams to release new features and bug fixes rapidly and reliably.</td>
            <td>Jez Humble and David Farley - "Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation" (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/continuous-delivery-reliable/9780321670250/)</td>

        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</td>
            <td>Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure (servers, networks, etc.) using code and automation tools. IaC enables version control, consistency, and reproducibility of infrastructure, reducing manual errors and simplifying system management.</td>
            <td>Kief Morris - "Infrastructure as Code: Managing Servers in the Cloud" (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/infrastructure-as-code/9781491924389/)</td>

        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>Microservices</td>
            <td>Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with others through APIs. This approach enhances scalability, flexibility, and allows teams to develop and deploy services independently.</td>
            <td>Sam Newman - "Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems" (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices-designing/9781491950340/)</td>

        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>Version Control System (VCS)</td>
            <td>Version Control System is a software tool that enables teams to track changes to code and other artifacts. It allows developers to collaborate effectively, manage conflicts, and roll back changes when needed. Git is one of the most popular VCS used in DevOps workflows.</td>
            <td>Eric Sink - "Version Control by Example" (https://ericsink.com/vcbe/)</td>

            <td>Monitoring and Observability</td>
            <td>Monitoring and Observability are essential practices in DevOps for gaining insights into the performance and behavior of applications and infrastructure. Monitoring focuses on collecting metrics, while observability emphasizes understanding the system's internal state based on those metrics.</td>
            <td>Cindy Sridharan - "Distributed Systems Observability" (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-systems-observability/9781492033431/)</td>

        <tr>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>Automated Testing</td>
            <td>Automated Testing involves using tools and scripts to automatically test software applications. It includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Automated testing helps ensure the application's quality and enables rapid and reliable deployments.</td>
            <td>Jeff Payne - "Continuous Testing for DevOps Professionals" (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/continuous-testing-for-devops/9780134193186/)</td>

        <tr>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>Containerization</td>
            <td>Containerization is a technology that allows applications and their dependencies to be packaged and isolated from the underlying system. Docker is a popular containerization platform, enabling consistent deployment across different environments.</td>

            <td>Configuration Management</td>
            <td>Configuration Management is the process of automating the management of software configurations and system settings. It ensures consistency across various environments and simplifies the deployment and scaling of applications.</td>

            <td>Incident Management:</td>
            <td>Incident Management involves identifying, responding to, and resolving incidents or disruptions in the production environment. It aims to restore normal operations as quickly as possible and minimize the impact on users.</td>
